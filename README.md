# Educational Material for Girls Who Code at Boston University

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository, where I've curated a selection of educational materials and slides I developed and taught as part of my involvement with the Girls Who Code club at Boston University. This repository reflects my individual contribution to empowering young women in technology through hands-on teaching and mentorship. Here, you'll find lesson plans and presentations aimed at elementary, middle, and college-level students, covering topics from Scratch and Python programming to using GitHub and professional development with LinkedIn and resumes.

## About This Repository

As a treasurer and executive board leader for the Girls Who Code club at BU, I dedicated myself to not only administrative duties but also to the technical education and empowerment of our members. The materials here showcase my personal approach to introducing coding concepts, fostering development skills, and preparing students for the tech industry.
