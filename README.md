# Educational Material for Girls Who Code at Boston University

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository, where I've curated a selection of educational materials and slides I developed and taught as part of my involvement with the Girls Who Code club at Boston University. This repository reflects my individual contribution to empowering young women in technology through hands-on teaching and mentorship. Here, you'll find lesson plans and presentations aimed at elementary, middle, and college-level students, covering topics from Scratch and Python programming to using GitHub and professional development with LinkedIn and resumes.

## About This Repository

As a treasurer and executive board leader for the Girls Who Code club at BU, I dedicated myself to not only administrative duties but also to the technical education and empowerment of our members. The materials here showcase my personal approach to introducing coding concepts, fostering development skills, and preparing students for the tech industry.

## Some of the workshops and classes that I taught

### GWC Bits
- A beginner's guide to Scratch, designed to spark interest in programming through interactive stories and games. We taught weekly classes to elementary school students over Zoom covering the fundamentals of Scratch and programming, and helped the students to create their own version of Flappy Bird.

### GWC Bytes
- An advanced lesson on Python, focusing on more complex concepts suitable for middle school students ready to dive deeper into coding. Weekly classes for both beginners and advanced students, aimed to give students the tools they need for entering the programming world.

### GWC GitHub Slides: Using GitHub for College Members
- **File:** GWC Github Slides.pdf
- Comprehensive slides on the basics of Git and GitHub, tailored for college students to effectively manage and collaborate on coding projects.

### GWC LinkedIn and Resume Slides: Professional Development
- **File:** GWC Linkedin and Resume slides.pdf
- A guide on crafting effective resumes and LinkedIn profiles, aimed at helping college members of the Girls Who Code club enhance their job prospects in the tech industry.

## Additional Workshops

Beyond these specific lessons, I also led workshops in:
- **Python:** I covered many of the basics of Python in an intro to coding and development workshop for students at BU.
- **JavaScript:** I contributed to a more advanced workshop covering async/await and good coding practices within JavaScript.
- **Treasury:** I taught the functions of the treasurer's role within a student led club, and how to plan and budget expenses throughout a semester.
